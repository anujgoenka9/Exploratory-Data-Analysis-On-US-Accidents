# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-On-US-Accidents
The objective of this repository is to give an idea of Exploratory Data Analysis on any dataset by understanding its basic steps. We will be cleaning and preparing the data and then we will analyze it with different plots and visualizations.

You can access the dataset from [this](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents) website.

## Insights Gained from the EDA

 - The Severity analysis reveals that the vast majority of accidents are of type 2 -89.1%
 - For six years in the State of South Carolina, there is 1 in every 25 people gets into an accident.
 - Over six years in the City of Miami, 1 in every 4 people gets into an accident. 
   (This might be debatable since the data doesn't consider the number of tourists that get into an accident in the city)
 - Less than 5% of cities have more than 1000 yearly accidents.
 - The state of California recorded the largest number of accidents.
 - 24.77% of accidents occurred on Street I-5 N in the last 6 years (2016-2021) in the US.
 - Accidents took place despite having average visibility of ~9 miles. This could mean that low visibility was not a reason.
 - For about 75% of the accidents, no precipitation was reported. This could mean that rain was not a problem.
 - Most of the accidents happen between 6 am and 10 am and also between 2 pm and 7 pm. This might be because, people leave and get back from work during these intervals,      which results in greater movement of population and hence a higher chance of accidents.
 - Accidents are more on weekdays than the weekends
 - Among the months December has the maximum number of accidents followed by November.
 - Accidents are common at a junction, crossing, or a traffic signal
 - Average no. of accidents occurring per hour in the year 2021 is 167.26 which is the highest of any year in the database. Although this might be a shortcoming of the data collected before and not exactly an indication of the fact that the accidents are increasing in this exponential way
